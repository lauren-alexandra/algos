Pillars of OOP

- Encapsulation: hide details about our code. Access modifiers like public/private give 
explicit control of our encapsulation. The key to good software design.

- Inheritance: the ability to reuse code across similar classes.

- Polymorphism: allows us to have objects of the same type that behave differently.
