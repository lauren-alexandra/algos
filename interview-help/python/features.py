Python

Python is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that provides rapid application development. 
It was released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum. 
It has huge demand in in the Rapid Application Development field due to its dynamic binding and dynamic typing options.

It is an interpreted language which means interpreter implements the code line by line at a single time.

Python interprets at runtime the instructions that you provide. 
This design makes python considerable slower than compiled languages like C++ or FORTRAN.

It is dynamically-typed language i.e. the type of a value is finalized at runtime.

Python includes a large number of libraries that are built-in; many of the libraries are for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
