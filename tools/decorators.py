Decorators

are functions which modify the functionality of other functions

e.g. @decorator is equivalent to:

some_func = decorator(some_func)
"""

"""
this is what decorators do in python
they wrap a given function and modify its functionality

When you use the @my_decorator syntax, you are applying a wrapper 
function with a single function as a parameter. 

Remember, everything in Python is an object, and this includes 
functions! With that in mind, we can write a function that returns 
a wrapper function.

Note: @wraps takes a function to be decorated and adds the 
functionality of copying over the function name, docstring, 
arguments list, etc. This allows us to access the pre-decorated 
functionâ€™s properties in the decorator.
