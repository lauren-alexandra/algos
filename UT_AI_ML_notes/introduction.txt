AI vs. ML vs. DL vs. DS

Artificial Intelligence

a machine can mimic human behavior


Machine Learning

a machine learns from historical data and using statistical models it is able to 
predict future outcomes


Deep Learning

a subset of machine learning that specifically deals with neural networks and can
perform human tasks


Data Science

a combination of three skills
1) Computer Science and technology
2) Math & Statistics
3) Domain/Business Knowledge

encompasses humans making decisions as the result of using the above three skills
to produce e.g. a business outcome


UT Flipped Classroom approach

- Lectures are watched BEFORE coming to class.
- Class time (mentored learning sessions) is devoted to applied 
learning activities and more higher-order tasks like solving problems. 
- Students receive support from instructor and peers as needed.

Lectures

- 2-3 hours of video lectures a week
- reference reading material
- quizzes


Mentored Learning Sessions

- online collaborative, interactive learning space
- demonstration of hands-on!
- solidify concepts
- come prepared and ask questions. yes 


Apply hands-on

- practice hands-on
- practice exercises
- project in each module (every month) 


Every week - the best learners follow this habit/get into this rhythm: 
1st: You will get the content on Friday. Watch video lectures to understand 
the fundamentals. As you watch the lecture, run the code along with the professor
and make sure you are getting the same results.

2nd: Practice hands-on and read to explore concepts and test your 
understand

3rd: Collaborate on a case study in mentored learning session to clarify
your doubts 

You receive the video content and reading material on Friday.
You have the week to go over the content and complete the quiz
by the end of the next Friday (deadline). 
Then on Sunday you have our Mentored Learning Session. 

Each month you have 3 quizzes (1 a week) and last week is the project week due
on same Friday deadline. 


Mentored Learning Session Structure:
- 10 mins: mentors gauge the level of understanding of learners and identify 
things to focus on
- 20 mins: clarify doubts on concepts/learnings from the course of the week.
topics the majority of the group wants to cover are prioritized.
- 60 mins: Case Study: Work hands-on in Python and show how to 'apply' the technique.
- 25 mins: Extended doubt clearing: additional questions that need not be addressed. 
- 5 mins: summarize the session


Credit/Performance: 
In order to be eligible for certificate, you will have to complete all modules
with a minimum of 60% in each module (each month). 
- Weekly Quizzes: 
are deadline driven (can't miss) and are 30 points a month.
- Project (monthly): 
is a problem to be solved hands-on with final outputs to be submitted along with
code
is worth 60 points/marks a month/module
there are no extensions for projects. if you miss a deadline, you have to do another project.
- Attendance in Mentored Learning Sessions:
each session is 10 points/marks in each module
