# Recursion

Method of solving problems by breaking a problem
down into smaller subproblems.

Recursion involves a function calling itself.

## Three laws of recursion:

Recursive algorithms must

1) have a base case
2) change its state and move toward the base case
3) call itself, recursively

First, a base case is the condition that allows the algorithm to stop recursing. A base case is typically a problem that is small enough to solve directly. In the sum_of algorithm the base case is a list of length 1.
