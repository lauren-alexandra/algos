Why choose React?

1) Flexibility: 
Can use it for a variety of platforms and 
use cases.
Less opinionated than Angular.
Is a library not a framework.

Where can I use React?
- web apps
- static sites like Gatsby
- mobile - react native
- desktop
- VR (virtual reality)


React Renderers 
- react-dom
- react-native
- react-vr 	


2) Developer Experience
It offers a simple API that is very easy to learn.
You'll rarely use the docs.

JSX compiles to JS.
<h1>my title</h1>
is compiled to 
React.createElement("h1", "my title")

Unlike Angular and Vue which use directives
to make HTML more powerful, React just includes
embedded JS e.g. {user.map(createUser)} 


3) Corporate Investment
- created and maintained by Facebook
- Microsoft open sourced UI Fabric, a 
React component library that is a collection 
of UX frameworks that look like Microsoft Office
- Material UI has react components that use Google's
Material Design 

Community
- huge popularity 
- answers on stack overflow

4) Ecosystem
- React Router - routes
- Redux - state management, handle data flow
- Jest (FB) - automated testing 
- GraphQL - an alternative to RESTful API calls
where you can declare you API calls on the client


5) Performance
- Why a virtual DOM? 
Updating the DOM is expensive. So React minimizes
DOM changes. 

Lightweight library: ~35Kb minified.


6) Testability
Testing in React:
- little to no config required
- run in-memory via Node
- fast
- can write reliable, deterministic unit tests
- write quickly, update easily
