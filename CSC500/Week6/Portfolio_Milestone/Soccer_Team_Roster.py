Step 3 (of portfolio): Prompt the user to input five pairs of numbers: A player's jersey number (0 - 99) and the player's rating (1 - 9). Store the jersey numbers and the ratings in a dictionary. Output the dictionary's elements with the jersey numbers in ascending order (i.e., output the roster from smallest to largest jersey number). Hint: Dictionary keys can be stored in a sorted list. (3 pts)

(see example in Assignment Instructions)

Step 4 (of portfolio): Step 4: Implement a menu of options for a user to modify the roster. Each option is represented by a single character. The program initially outputs the menu after a user chooses an option. The program ends when the user chooses the option to Quit. For this step, the other options do nothing.
