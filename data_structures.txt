Data Structures

- Coding is manipulating data to accomplish something.
- Data structures are a way to organize and manage data. 
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the 
relationships among them, and the functions or operations 
that can be applied to the data. 

Complexity Analysis 

- a problem can have multiple solutions, but some are better than others
- the bedrock of coding interviews
- time complexity
	- measure of how fast an algorithm runs
- space complexity 
	- how much memory or space an algorithm uses up 
- referred together as space-time complexity
- different data structures are going to have different
time and space complexity ramifications

Memory

- why is space important? memory is not unlimited. 
- comprised of bits, 0s and 1s. 8 bits = byte.
- byte e.g. 0000 0001 
- this is (2^7 2^6 2^5 2^4  2^3 2^2 2^1 2^0) binary number format (base-2 format)
- 256 possible values in a byte
- how to store more than value 256? increase the number of bits
that are stored in a data value. for 16- or 32- or 64-bit 
architecture 
- can point to another memory address from current memory address.
this is a pointer.
- a list of items needs to be stored back-to-back in memory slots
that must be free
