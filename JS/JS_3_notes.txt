Types

Most of the values in JavaScript can behave
like an object but that does not make them objects.
This is not true: "everything is an object."

Primitive Types
- undefined
- string
- number
- boolean
- object 
- symbol (es6). used to create pseudo-private keys on objects.
Symbol(); 

Variables do not have types. Values do.

typeof null // returns "object" 
// this is a historical bug in JS. should return "null"


Emptiness 
undefined vs undeclared vs uninitialized (temporal dead zone - TDZ)

TDZ
Certain variables like block scope ones never get initialized as undefined.

Undefined
Variable has been initialized but not defined.

Undeclared
Variable has never been created.
