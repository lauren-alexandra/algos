Stacks

Linear data structure (stacks, queues, deques, and lists):  Once an item is added, it stays in the same position relative to its neighbors. 

Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is where additions and removals may occur.

A stack is an ordered collection of items where the addition of new items and the removal of existing items always takes place at the same end. 

This end is commonly referred to as the “top”, and the opposite end is known as the “base”.

Top Plate (the end of the stack)  --> will be removed first. The insertion order is the reverse of the removal order.

An abstract data type means that we’re only concerned with what the data represents and not with how it’ll be constructed.

A data structure is an implementation of an abstract data type.

The separation of these two perspectives allows us to define complex data models for our problems without giving any 
details about how the model will actually be built.
