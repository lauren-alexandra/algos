Lists are a built-in type and do not require an imported module. Also like you said, list elements can be of different types. 
Arrays on the other hand are good for mathematical operations and storing large amounts of data; if you don't need this, use a list.

When you build a list in Python, you really donâ€™t need to specify how large the array or list is beforehand, 
instead, in Python, the list is of dynamic nature i.e. we could just keep adding the item constantly. 
So, How does Python actually do this? Well, the answer is dynamic arrays.

List comprehension

List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create a list in python. 
We can create lists just like mathematical statements and in one line only. 
The syntax of list comprehension is easier to grasp.

A list comprehension generally consist of these parts:

Output expression,
Input sequence,
A variable representing a member of the input sequence and
An optional predicate part.
"""
lst  =  [x ** 2  for x in range (1, 11)   if  x % 2 == 1] 

      here, x ** 2 is output expression, 
      range (1, 11)  is input sequence, 
      x is variable and   
      if x % 2 == 1 is predicate part.
