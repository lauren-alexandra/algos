Data Structures

- Coding is manipulating data to accomplish something.
- Data structures are a way to organize and manage data. 
- A data structure is a collection of data values, the 
relationships among them, and the functions or operations 
that can be applied to the data. 

Complexity Analysis 

- a problem can have multiple solutions, but some are better than others
- the bedrock of coding interviews
- time complexity
	- measure of how fast an algorithm runs
- space complexity 
	- how much memory or space an algorithm uses up 
- referred together as space-time complexity
- different data structures are going to have different
time and space complexity ramifications
