* The 5 major browsers today

Chrome (open source)

* The browser's functionality

Browsers present the web resource (HTML document,
PDF, or other content) you choose by making a
request to a server and displaying the resource
in the browser window. 

The resource location is the URI (uniform
resource identifier).

* The browser's high level structure

1. The UI
2. The browser engine: controls the ordering of
actions between UI and rendering engine
3. The rendering engine: responsible for 
displaying requested content. e.g. If 
content is HTML, the rendering engine parses the
HTML and displays the content. 
4. Networking: for network calls such as HTTP
requests, using different implementations for
different platform behind a platform-independent
interface. 
5. UI backend: used for drawing basic widgets like
combo boxes and windows. This backend exposes 
a generic interface that is not platform specific.
Underneath it uses operating system user interface methods.
6. JavaScript interpreter: Used to parse and execute JS code.
7. Data storage: This is a persistance layer.
the browser may need to save all sorts of data locally,
such as cookies. Browsers also support storage mechanisms
such as localStorage, IndexedDB, WebSQL, and FileSystem.
