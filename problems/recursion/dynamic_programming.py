1014. Best Sightseeing Pair

You are given an integer array values where values[i] represents the value of the ith sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots i and j 
have a distance j - i between them.

The score of a pair (i < j) of sightseeing spots is values[i] + values[j] + i - j: the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, 
minus the distance between them.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

Example 1:

Input: values = [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, values[i] + values[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11


Example 2:

Input: values = [1,2]
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

2 <= values.length <= 5 * 104
1 <= values[i] <= 1000

221. Maximal Square

Given an m x n binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest square containing only 1's and return its area.

Example 1:

Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 4

Input: matrix = [["0"]]

198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint 
stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected andÂ **it will automatically contact 
the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array nums representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob 
tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
