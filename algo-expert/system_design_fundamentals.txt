Client--Server Model

The paradigm by which modern systems are designed, which consists of clients requesting
data or service from servers and servers providing data or service to clients.

Client

A machine or process that requests data or service from a server. 
Note: a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same
time. For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client
for a database.

Server

A machine or process that provides data or service for a client, usually by listening for
incoming network calls. 
Note: a single machine or piece of software can be both a client and a server at the same time.
For instance, a single machine could act as a server for end users and as a client
for a database.

IP Address

An address given to each machine connected to the public internet. IPv4 addresses consist 
of four numbers separated by dots: a.b.c.d where all four numbers are between 0 and 255.

Special values include:
- 127.0.0.1: your local machine / localhost
- 192.168.x.y: your private network. For instance, your machine and all machines on your
private wifi network will usually have the 192.168 prefix. 

DNS 

Domain Name System: it describes the entities and protocols involved in the translation
from domain names to IP addresses. Typically machines make a DNS query to a well known
entity which is responsible for returning the IP address (or multiple ones) of the 
requested domain name in the response. 
A DNS query is made when you enter www.google.com in a browser. 


What are load balancers? 

Client		Load Balancer		Server

Balancing: rerouting traffic from clients so it doesn't go directly to one server but
to many load balancers. 

Load Balancer: a type of reverse proxy that distributes traffic across servers. Load 
balancers can be found in many parts of a system from the DNS layer all the way to the
database layer. 

Reverse Proxy: a server that sits between clients and servers and acts on behalf of the 
servers, typically used for logging, load balancing, or caching. 

Server-selection strategy: A strategy for how a load balancer chooses servers when 
distributing traffic amongst multiple servers. e.g. random selection, performance-based
selection (choose the server with the best peformance like fastest response time or 
least amount of traffic), and IP-based routing.

Hot Spot: Some servers will receive more traffic than others, creating a "hot spot."

Nginx: "engine X" is a webserver that is often used as a reverse proxy and load balancer.



Caching 

Latency: the time it takes for a certain operation to complete in a system. A measure
of time - duration in milliseconds or seconds. 

Throughput: the number of operations that a system can handle properly per time unit. 
Can be measured in requests per second (RPS).

Memory: short for Random Access Memory RAM. Data stored in memory will be lost when the 
process that has written that data dies. 

Cache: a piece of hardware or software that stores data typically meant to retrieve that
data faster than otherwise. 

Cache Hit: when requested data is found in a cache. 

Cache Miss: When requested data could have been found in a cache but isn't. e.g. If a server
goes down, a load balancer will have to forward requests to a new server, which results
in a cache miss.

Cache Eviction Policy: The policy by which values get evicted or removed from a cache. 
LRU - least-recently used
FIFO - first in first out
LFU - least-frequently used 

Content Delivery Network (CDN):
A third-party service like Cloudfare or Google Cloud CDN that acts like a cache for your
servers. A CDN has servers all around the world, meaning that the latency to a CDN's servers 
will almost always be better than the latency to your servers. A CDN's servers are often
referred to as PoPs (Points of Presence). 


Proxies

Reverse Proxy:
A server that sits between clients and servers and acts on behalf of the servers,
typically used for logging, load balancing, or caching. 

Forward Proxy:
A server that sits between a client and servers and acts on behalf of the client, typically
used to mask the client's identity (IP address). Often just referred to as proxies. 

Nginx:
"engine X" is a webserver that is often used as a load balancer or reverse proxy. 


Hashing

Hashing Function:
A function that takes in a specific data type (such as a string or an identifier) and outputs
a number. Different inputs may have the same output, but a good hashing function attempts to
minimize those hashing collisions. 

Consistent Hashing:
A type of hashing that minimizes the number of keys that need to be remapped when a hash
table gets resized. It's often used by load balancers to distribute traffic to servers; 
it minimizes the number of requests that get forwarded to different servers when new
servers are added or when existing servers are brought down. 

Rendezvous Hashing:
A type of hashing also coined highest random weight hashing. Allows for minimal re-distribution
of mappings when a server goes down.

SHA:
Short for "Secure Hash Algorithms" the SHA is a collection of cryptographic hash functions
used in the industry.
