JS fundamentals to functional

Functional programming is a programming style and about verbs
Includes pure functions without side effects. Makes code easier to test and trust.
They can’t affect any other data outside the scope of that function



Object oriented programming is about nouns

Primitive values get passed by value, e.g. string , number, boolean
Non-primitive values get passed by reference, e.g. arrays, objects, functions. It’s important that you don’t mutate your data (unintentionally by modifying the referenced/pointed at value). It is recommended to make copies of your data. 

Objects

Var person = {};		// object literal notation
Person.name = ‘mrs.white’;
Var person = {
	“Name”: “mrs.white”
};
