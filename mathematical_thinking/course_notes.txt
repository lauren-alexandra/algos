Proofs

- A proof is an argument that is so convincing that you are ready to use it to convince
other people

- Proof of Impossibility: 
given 8x8 board with one square removed and tiling with 1x2 dominos
we can't tile entire board because
one cell will always remain because
there are 63 = 8 x 8 - 1 cells which is an odd number
31 tiles cover 62 cells, one remains

- Another proof of impossibility:

Theorem: A chess board 8x8 without two opposite corners cannot 
be tiled by 1 x 2 dominos. 

Proof. [black | white] domino. 
- black and white cells
- opposite corners of chess board are (say) black
- gives us 30 black and 32 white
- a domino: two different colors
- (at least) two white remain after tiling
- quod erat demonstrandum - "that's what we wanted to prove"
